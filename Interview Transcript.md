00:03

And yeah, we do have some other questions as well, but if you have anything to like start with, like just like any main sort of information. Other questions for the interview or about the module? They're for the interview. Oh, right. Okay. They're not module related. Yeah.

 

00:22

So, yeah, sure. Right, welcome. Thank you for coming by. ah As you obviously know, I fired you to make a single-player 2D game in Java so we can get some early iteration to try to market it, see if we can get some more traction, and see if we want to extend it later on, or if we're just scrapping it and starting something new. um I heard you guys have questions on the development process that you want clarifications on. ah Let me know. I'll try to do my best to help you. Cool. Shall we start with our questions, then?

 

00:52

Yep. Alright, so I'll just ask the aesthetic questions and we can sort of move around, I guess. So one of the questions we have is what sort of art style are you looking for, if any? Yes, so the main thing that I've left open specifically is how you want the game to feel like in play, right? So if we're looking at artistic direction being one thing, that will tie into any background or lore or immersion aspect.

 

01:21

which will tie into how the world is built and how realistic or serious the game is. So all of these axes are something that I have seen similar games in the past do well. So you could have it a more dramatic, serious approach where you're actually trying to escape something realistic, whether that is physical or mental, like for example, you're trying to escape exams, you're trying to escape a literal dean or professor, or if it's something more humorous where you're just making fun of life at the university.

 

01:48

And it could be cartoony, for example, or sci-fi or something like that. So all of these angles will play a role into making a game that's consistent. So it would not make sense to give you direction in one of those unless I had a direction for the whole thing. And I think that any of those can sell. And since you have experience in that, I think it's much better if I give you the freedom to pick one. And then as I said, this is a short-term project. We're not investing multiple, multiple years on this.

 

02:17

Okay, cool. That's great. Thank you. I was going to ask, is there any particular color scheme you'd want or prefer either, does that sort of tie into the other question? So it does, but there is this one interesting aspect that if we're looking at how we want to market it and how we want to capture the audience, it would make much more sense if it's a bit more on the colorful and positive end than being super dark and grim. So obviously that makes it so that it leans towards

 

02:47

something that is more positive as an experience. And that is because we want it to be accessible to as many people as possible to open as much market as possible to get money. And also because we want it to be family friendly because of our audience being quite young adults, either going to uni or at uni or around those ages. Right. Okay. So family friendly is like a key thing as well then. All right. Cool. Yeah. That's the only aspect that I think is really important that will tie into colour scheme and everything else. Perfect. You can obviously have humorous depictions of something exploding.

 

03:17

but you wouldn't want to have someone head chopped off and it being either inappropriate or too dark. Yeah. Is there also a specific setting you want? So we were thinking we had some ideas of settings for like medieval potentially sci-fi, vaporwave, cyberpunk. Okay medieval sounds hilarious, but no, uh any of those are perfectly fine. As I said earlier, that will tie into the whole aesthetic, what the art is going to look like, right? Yeah. I can imagine some of them are only really applicable in a more humorous setting.

 

03:46

which is perfectly fine. Keep in mind that that's the only thing, that if you do pick something that is quite extreme, it would make sense that the game will also be quite extreme in what it's doing. Or at least related to that, so for example if it was medieval we'd like medieval related obstacles and things. Yes, no of course yes. Okay cool. That's why events and stuff are quite vague, because yes other than making someone move faster, it would really depend on what is around them, if it's a real maze made of walls, if it's...

 

04:15

people and ducks making you not be able to move. If it's your own thoughts, not being able to move, right? While the mechanics are still the same, you still have a geographic location that you're trying to traverse and you're blocked. Doesn't necessarily need to be concrete or stone that's blocking you. could be anything depending on the environment you're in. Perfect, thanks. And then the last question I'll ask for the aesthetic section is, um it was to do with if you didn't want a specific setting, but I guess you're fine with it all setting like me. Other than again, something that is way too extreme. Like if you have...

 

04:44

being in hell with demons chopping people's heads off. Let's avoid that then. All right. right. Cheers. All right. Would you like to do the next sort of section? So just like, yeah, right there. What do you mean by run the Dean is coming? Sorry, In the spec there was a line in run the Dean is coming. That was an example of something that could be humorous. Again, that could be

 

05:12

an NPC that's following you around, like a Pac-Man style or something, and you're doing a real time running away from someone. It could be just text bubbles that appear all the time that are really annoying. It could be anything that has to do with university. It doesn't have to be the dean. It could be anything you want, right? And whether it's in the game or whether it's somewhere around in the aesthetic that is making you want to escape, right? It's just an example of something. Anything I've given on the spec is an example of certain things that could make sense in some setting. Right? None of them.

 

05:42

of uh the specific examples of what an event can be. You don't necessarily need to use that specific example. The main thing is we want these types of mechanics that I mentioned. Should there be multiple difficulty levels? So at this stage, as I mentioned earlier, we want something that is accessible. We want to get a gauge on what's the biggest market we can capture. So for the first version that we're making, so for the first iteration, we want something that's quite easy.

 

06:13

for the audience that we're aiming at that. ah So we're not looking for someone to need to train multiple days in order to be able to get a good score and we don't want a five-year-old to be able to solve it immediately. Multiple difficulties are something that are going to be important moving forward but at the moment you have limited time and resources for your first version. So if you find a simple way of doing something like that that just

 

06:43

adjusts some variables in what you already have in the game. ah For one of the first two versions, it could be useful, ah but that's not a priority at all. We know that that is something we might want moving forward, but at the moment we want one accessible and straightforward example for the first version that we're releasing.

 

07:10

So in terms of obstacles that will block the progression, do you have any specific examples of things that you want at obstacles? No, because that on its own in a vacuum doesn't make any sense because it really depends on where things are happening. Right. If you have a medieval setting and you have an alien there, probably doesn't fit again, unless you're making some very humorous approach. Right. So a specific obstacle or event or

 

07:42

quest type thing, let's say, if you're trying to find something that opens something else, it would be purely reliant on the lore, let's say, and the aesthetic of the game. ah You could use, if you wanted to stick to something that is the University of York, you could stick to things that exist at the University of York, and you can have Long Boy being in medieval setting or in space, but you don't need to use any of these specifics, right? So we're not marketing it at this university, we're marketing it at

 

08:12

students, plus or minus. Who want to just make fun of all the things that they're And you also mentioned that there would be rewards throughout the game. So what sort of things? So it's the same as events, right? So an event could be something that is debuffing you, could be something that's hindering you. Rewards could be something that is either about the mechanics or it's about your score, all of those things, Just any other similar game that...

 

08:41

allows your character to have some difference as you're playing instead of just moving around and having a walking simulator. I was going ask you like a positive difference you mean? Well it depends as I said events can be anything so all of these. In of rewards what do mean? Well a reward would be positive.

 

08:57

But of course an event could be complicated. It might not just give you just three points, right? might tell you you get points if you go get this apple or whatever, right? Which then would require you to spend some time, potentially go through other dangerous terrain, all of those things. And potentially if you don't get the apple it could then hinder you somehow. Yeah, or it could just be you don't get the bonus. So those are all, you know, how you can have an infinite amount of different things you could do if you wanted to, right? And how this game can extend in the future if we end up having a good enough market we can...

 

09:27

Make sure that we're developing it in appropriate way So then either you or another if we extend your team and we give you more people Then or another team takes over the game and you start with a new one We can extend it and then make it add, you know skins all of these things and market the demon world Would you have or do you have any requests for a live system or how that might function? What do you mean? Oh in terms of the in terms of like

 

09:56

platforming your lives as in... Okay. um Absolutely no idea. ah Didn't cross my mind. It is something you could consider if you're putting it in that aesthetic of there's a trap and you might have a limited amount of times you can step on traps. But no, you hadn't thought about it. It's something you can consider depending on how you're... Because the game could either be... There's two ways I can see that the game could play. One of them is...

 

10:25

more chess-like and strategic where time passes when you make moves, when you move left, right, anywhere, right, and you're on a grid of And the other one is you just move around in real time, right? um And this idea of limited opportunities of doing things could either be done through the time because you have a set amount of moves or time to be able to do things, or it could be...

 

10:52

with using other resources such as money, lives, foods to give to animals, anything like that, right? So you could have more than one resource that the player has if you wanted to. And lives make a lot of sense as one if you wanted to.

 

11:07

See we use AI for our games, it's amazing. Very reliable. Thank you very much. uh In terms of the hidden events, do these specifically have to be something different to the blocking or beneficial events? Well they will still do one of those things, right? You either help or hinder the player, there's not much more you can do. It's just you don't see them until you interact with them. That's it, that's why they're hidden.

 

11:32

We're thinking they could just be like an Easter egg where it could be. Yes, an event could just be the longbow pops up and gives you some points or bites you and slows you down for a bit or whatever. Yes, it could be something that is not necessarily such a big thing. Right. It could be an Easter egg. Yeah, that sounds very interesting as well. For sure.

 

11:57

Um.

 

12:01

Are the events with two parts, like a door and a key, counted as one or two events?

 

12:09

Make the game fun. That's not going to be the end of the world. Right. If you want to be on the safe side, treat it as one event, a quest that allows you to open something. For the Hymn to Events that only require one object, like a professor blocking away, what is the corresponding action that is required for the player to progress? Don't shoot them. Do something else that is a bit more family friendly.

 

12:40

Other than that, I no idea. That's why you guys are the experts here, to have something that is enjoyable and immersive, right? Anything that is within the scope of the game in terms of the aesthetic and the lore of your game and for that audience, and is appropriate for that audience, it could be anything. It could be serious humour, similar to what I was saying to your colleague. And then for sort of moving on to the general tone of the game, is there like a particular theme that we should incorporate or...?

 

13:10

And then can we make some of the interactions local relevant to this university? does the game need to be? As I said earlier, it's up to you. You could make some that have local meaning and that could obviously go into more maps and more universities down the line if you wanted to, but it's not mandatory. And I think you've already pretty much answered whether it should be lighthearted or serious. uh

 

13:39

how much creative freedom do we have? So is there like any room to play about with the idea of escaping university or is it sort of? Yeah, as I said at the very beginning, it doesn't have to be literal.

 

13:54

em And then last question on here, are there any other features that haven't been mentioned so far? No, that's not the point.

 

14:06

I wanted to add a quick question as well. So when you're talking about creative freedom, does that mean things like the map doesn't even have to be a university itself or how much, how far can you really go with that? As long as it's obvious to the player. As long as that user group. So people that are just going to uni or at uni or maybe have just finished uni, right? Those five years, let's say. As long as it's very obvious to them that that's what it's representing. University of York. No, no, no. Escaping a university setting. Okay.

 

14:35

It doesn't have to be a literal set of buildings. Again, could be you could be dreaming and it could be you're floating among clouds that are different things you need to do at university. Again, as long as the game's mechanics are puzzle style game that is escaping a maze. So you're moving in on a geographic location on a map. And you have places you can go to and places you can not go to, which is what defines a maze. What the maze is made of and what you're escaping from.

 

15:05

That is where you can make an interesting game and we can get lots of money. That's the point, right? It shouldn't be boring. It can be straightforward and more serious, right? And then the interest there won't necessarily be the game or its assets. might be the... Gameplay. Obviously, it's always going to be the gameplay, but I mean in terms of it will be the... What's the word? Like, not the story, the...

 

15:31

I can't think of the word, but anyway, uh as you're playing the game, you're immersed into the character and what is happening, right? Cool, I see. This was at the end of the questions.

 

15:48

Nothing else? Cool. We could probably wrap that up then. So one important thing we need to make sure of is that we don't get sued. Right? So make sure anything that you use is attributed properly and

 

16:04

No copyright basically. Well, all of them are to be copyrighted. Just use the appropriate licenses. won't find anything that's not copyrighted. It's just, it will be allowed to be used for a certain license, you know, which is applicable for what we want, right? Is there an actual risk of the university getting into legal trouble? Are you the customer or me? Me or the customer? You.

 

16:30

No, of course not. We're doing a research project, in a research, we're doing a taught course. Right. It doesn't matter what you use. This is all internal to your course. None of it is being like sold. So no, obviously the risk is you'll lose some marks. Cool. That's all I know. How do you check though? Cause like, if someone accidentally used a copyrighted thing? You know what like reverse images churches are, right?

 

16:57

Pretty straightforward, which is what you should be doing to check it and prove that you've done it. Like it's very straightforward. Technology really helps with that. Yeah, you go will just tell you just use it. Like most things that are on the internet in any asset site, let's say, somewhere there'll be a button saying attribute me or something. Just please get people to come to my site. That's pretty much the vast majority of licenses for open assets and sound and all that stuff. It's mainly put my logo somewhere and get people to keep clicking on me.

 

17:27

That's one very common type of freeware basically that is available, especially for assets and all these things. Obviously there can be assets that are not allowed for commercial use or you can only use them for non-commercial use and then for commercial use you need to pay them or something. There's a lot of different licenses. On Monday you'll hear about it. Tommy's giving like a IP thingy on Monday. Does that mean we'd need like a credit screen in-game? Yeah, you'd have somewhere for attributing

 

17:56

So in your game, if you're using stuff that says attribute me in the game, you'll have, I mean, it doesn't have to be a credit screen. It could just be on the main menu. You could have on the bottom like logos and stuff, right? Or you could have like, as you said, a credit screen or like a user's screen or something, I don't know, like something on the menu or something in the game. Yeah. But yes, obviously that's one of the reasons credits exist as well, certainly. Yeah. But yes, it's usually reasonably straightforward. Any of those sites have it somewhere.

 

18:23

reasonably obvious because you know they want A to make sure that they're getting credit and more people are to go to them and they get more traffic and B that you can find it without having to bother them. Do you have any sort of preference as to how the game will play in the control scheme, something like that? No, use ideas from previous games that are straightforward. We know that this is going to run on a desktop PC, right?

 

18:52

which is always something you didn't ask. I was going to tell you later stuff you forgot. You have no idea where the game is meant to run. So going into that there, know, like basic specs, lab PC stuff. So controls things that PCs have. mouse keyboard stuff. Because the whole idea of how he's selling the game is marketed to lots of people. You want to give it to people that already have everything. They wouldn't need anything to play it, right? They wouldn't need a better computer. They wouldn't need a different screen or...

 

19:20

different peripherals, all those things, right? Cool. Yeah, yeah, so um we touched upon who the game is for. um I mentioned just now on where it's meant to run, on what it's meant to do. We discussed on the various aesthetics and how we want it to play and what the limitations are on the, you know, how intense certain things can be um and the legal stuff. And then,

 

19:55

those are the main things that you need to make sure you ask, right? um As you realize, depending on who you're interacting with, they may be really particular in the very specifics of what is being done, whether that is the aesthetic or whether that is the actual mechanics. Some companies will have IPs that they want to continue using, right? Some people will not have...

 

20:23

either the ability because they're not experts in that or the time to care about it. They're paying you to do it. So it's like, make me some money. But then the main limitations are what they're going to market because they have a marketing department that has specific capabilities, who they're marketing to, where it's going to be. It's going to be on Steam. we're like, who's the audience going to be? How is it going to be advertised? Right. And that's going to limit the platforms and all those things. Right. Oh Also the platforms obviously, you know, run on operating system.

 

20:50

Stuff like that is things you should have also asked. But you asked a couple of important aspects that are not just about, you know, where does the player go. But that was, that's the main idea. The main idea is to think about all the other things that if you don't know and you don't agree upon in your contract with your customer, which is what this is, ah the customer can just come at any time and be like, do this, go make a mevo bug in. ah So that's the main idea that right. Yeah, obviously the game itself is important. That is the first thing that every single team will think about, right? So it's very obvious. And that's the reason why we.

 

21:20

try not to mention any of this before because every one of you for two decades now have been doing this, right? And the whole point is to see that, those things can be important. And sometimes in many cases, the customer will just be really annoying and ask for particular things that are pointless. But on the other hand, they can give you freedom and then you need to think about all the other things and not just be at ease that everything is okay. Because there's lots of organizational issues, technical issues, legal issues that, yes, a good customer will bring it up.

 

21:49

but it's your responsibility to protect yourselves as well in these types of meetings. So I know obviously as a junior software engineer, that's not something you might immediately do, but customer meetings and large projects are one of the biggest and most annoying aspects of organizing big pieces of software or systems that are being built. And usually they go through multiple weeks or months of iterations and all of that stuff. Obviously we're just doing a baseline here where you've agreed it with your customer. um Of course.

 

22:18

since you're unsure at the moment on some things, in the practical you can just be like, okay, these two requirements, I'm not really sure if I understood them correctly. Does the customer agree? I'll just tell you yes, no, So there's anything you're unsure about, know, that's not it, you're not done. I can always come and help you. If you are reasonably certain on all of the requirements, that's okay as well. You can just continue. But I'm here every week with practicals. You can just immediately ask me for anything that's unclear. Are there any other thoughts either about this or about in general the assessment? For assessment one, do you know?

 

22:48

What's left? What do need to do? Are you comfortable that, you know, that, okay, yes, you need to do all this stuff, but, you know, is the stuff that you need to do straightforward at the moment or any other thoughts or questions you might have? I think I'm fine with everything, unless I don't ask any questions.

 

23:05

Okay, brilliant. Well, have a lovely day. Perfect. Thank you very much.
