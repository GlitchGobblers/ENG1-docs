### Aesthetics & Art Style

*   **Question:** What art style are you looking for?
    *   **Answer:** The artistic direction is open and should align with the overall feel of the game (e.g., dramatic, serious, or humorous). The style could be cartoony, sci-fi, or something else, but it needs to be consistent with the game's world and lore. The developers have the freedom to choose a direction they think will sell, as this is a short-term project.

*   **Question:** Is there a particular color scheme you'd prefer?
    *   **Answer:** While tied to the art style, the game should lean towards being more colorful and positive rather than dark and grim. This is to make it accessible to a wider market, particularly young adults, and to ensure it is family-friendly.

*   **Question:** Is there a specific setting you want, such as medieval, sci-fi, vaporwave, or cyberpunk?
    *   **Answer:** Any of those settings are fine, as long as it ties into the overall aesthetic and is not too extreme (e.g., "being in hell with demons chopping people's heads off"). The chosen setting should inform the types of obstacles and events in the game.

### Gameplay & Mechanics

*   **Question:** In the spec, what did you mean by "run the Dean is coming"?
    *   **Answer:** This was just a humorous example of something that could be in the game. It could be a Pac-Man-style NPC that follows the player, annoying text bubbles, or anything else related to university life that creates a sense of wanting to escape. The specific examples in the spec are not mandatory.

*   **Question:** Should there be multiple difficulty levels?
    *   **Answer:** For the initial version, the focus should be on a single, accessible, and straightforward difficulty level to appeal to the broadest possible market. Multiple difficulties are a potential future feature but are not a priority for this first iteration due to limited time and resources.

*   **Question:** Do you have any specific examples of obstacles that will block progression?
    *   **Answer:** No, because obstacles should be dependent on the game's setting and lore. For instance, an alien in a medieval setting wouldn't make sense unless the game has a very humorous tone. The obstacles can be anything from physical walls to people or even the player's own thoughts.

*   **Question:** What kind of rewards will be in the game?
    *   **Answer:** Similar to events, rewards can be anything that positively affects the player's mechanics or score, adding variety beyond just moving around. An event could offer points for completing a task, which might involve navigating through challenges.

*   **Question:** Do you have any requests for a life system?
    *   **Answer:** This hadn't been considered, but it's an option depending on the game's design. The game could be turn-based and strategic or real-time. Limited opportunities could be managed through a time limit, a set number of moves, or resources like lives, money, or food.

*   **Question:** Do the hidden events have to be different from blocking or beneficial events?
    *   **Answer:** No, they will still either help or hinder the player. The only difference is that they are not visible until the player interacts with them. They could also function as Easter eggs, like a character suddenly appearing to give points or slow the player down.

*   **Question:** Are events with two parts, like a door and a key, counted as one or two events?
    *   **Answer:** To be on the safe side, it should be treated as one event—a quest to open something. The main goal is to make the game fun.

*   **Question:** For events that require a single object, like a professor blocking the way, what is the required action for the player to progress?
    *   **Answer:** The action should be family-friendly and fit within the game's aesthetic and lore. The developers, as the experts, should come up with something enjoyable and immersive.

### General Tone & Creative Freedom

*   **Question:** Is there a particular theme we should incorporate?
    *   **Answer:** The creative freedom is broad.

*   **Question:** Can we make some of the interactions locally relevant to this university?
    *   **Answer:** You can include locally relevant content, but it is not mandatory as the game is being marketed to students in general, not just those from one university.

*   **Question:** How much creative freedom do we have with the idea of escaping university?
    *   **Answer:** The concept of "escaping university" does not have to be literal. It can be a metaphorical or dream-like representation, as long as it's clear to the target audience (university students or those of a similar age) that it represents a university setting. The core mechanic should still be a puzzle-style game of escaping a maze on a map.

*   **Question:** Are there any other features that haven't been mentioned?
    *   **Answer:** No, the focus is on the core concept.

### Technical & Legal

*   **Question:** Do we need a credit screen in the game?
    *   **Answer:** Yes, if you use assets that require attribution, you will need to include credits. This can be a dedicated credit screen or logos on the main menu.

*   **Question:** What is the preference for the control scheme?
    *   **Answer:** Use straightforward controls suitable for a desktop PC, such as a mouse and keyboard. The game is intended to be accessible to a wide audience without requiring special peripherals.

*   **Question:** What platform should the game run on?
    *   **Answer:** The game is meant to run on standard lab PCs, so it should have basic specifications. It should also run on common operating systems.

*   **Question:** Is there a risk of the university getting into legal trouble over copyright?
    *   **Answer:** No, because this is an internal course project and is not being sold. However, any assets used must be properly licensed and attributed to avoid losing marks. It is the developers' responsibility to check for appropriate licenses, and reverse image searches can be used for this.
