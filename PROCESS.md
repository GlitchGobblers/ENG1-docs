# Agile & Scrum framework
<br></br>

## Agile - The Philosophy

- **Software that works is key:** Our main goal is to have a playable piece of the game (even individual interactions) at the end of each short work cycle (better than having lots of documentation but a game that doesn't run).
- **Customer Collaboration:** We have a customer. Getting their feedback regularly to ensure we're building the right thing is key.
- **Responding to Change:** Agile is perfect for handling changes such as discovering new ideas, encountering problems, and taking over another team's project.
- **Team Collaboration:** Agile relies on self-organising teams. Our roles should be flexible - success comes from everyone feeling responsible for the final product.

## Scrum - The Framework

In official Scrum, there are only three roles. Here is how we will adapt:

- **Product Owner:** They represents the customer and decides what the team should build. They are in charge of the master to-do list.
  - **Charles (Requirements Lead)** will be responsible for talking to the lecturer, understanding the requirements, and prioritising the features to be built.
- **Scrum Master:** They are a facilitator and coach not by managing the team, but by managing the process. They will help the team use Scrum effectively, remove any obstacles ("we can't decide on a library"), and keep things running smoothly.
  - **Dash's (Project Lead)** role will not be to be a traditional "boss" but to serve the team by ensuring our Scrum process works.
- **The Development Team:** In Scrum, everyone is a developer responsible for delivering a finished piece of the game.


### The Scrum Events

Scrum is organised into Sprints: short, time-boxed periods where we build a small, usable part of the game.

- **The Sprint:**
  - A fixed-length work cycle (one or two weeks).
  - For our first assessment, we will use 1-week Sprints. This gives us four cycles of building, getting feedback, and improving. For the second cycle, we can stick with one week or move to two-week Sprints.
1. **Sprint Planning:**
  - When: At the beginning of a new Sprint.
  - What we do: The whole team gets together. The Product Owner (Charles) presents the highest priority features from the master list. Everyone decides how much of that work we can realistically complete within the one-week Sprint. We then break down the features into small, concrete tasks.
  - Example: Charles might say the priority is "Player Movement." We then break this down into tasks: "Create Player sprite", "Write code to handle keyboard input", "Implement collision detection with walls".
2. **Daily Scrum:**
  - When: Every day.
  - What we do: Each person answers three questions:
    - What did I do yesterday to help the team finish the Sprint?
    - What will I do today to help the team finish the Sprint?
    - Do I see any impediments (blockers)?
  - We can do this in our Instagram chat. The Scrum Master (Dash) ensures this happens and takes note of any blockers to help resolve them.
  - Obviously, we aren't going to be working on ENG1 every single day, so we only need to answer these questions on days when we will work. We can reframe the 'what did I do yesterday' to be 'what did I do 2 days ago' or similar.
3. **Sprint Review:**
  - When: At the end of the Sprint.
  - What we do: Demonstrate the working software we built during the Sprint. This is a live demo of the game. The goal is to get feedback from each other.
  - This is the perfect time to show progress to the team and, if possible, our customer. After our first Sprint, we might show a character moving around a basic map.
4. **Sprint Retrospective:**
  - When: After the Sprint Review, before the next Sprint Planning.
  - What we do: This is an internal team meeting. We discuss how the Sprint went from a process perspective. What went well? What didn’t? What will you change in the next Sprint to improve?
  - This is a crucial meeting for learning. Hannah (Secretary) could be responsible for documenting the one or two "action items" the team agrees to implement in the next Sprint.

### Scrum Artifacts

**Product Backlog:**
- The single, master to-do list for the entire project, ordered by priority. The Product Owner (Charles) is responsible for maintaining it.
- We will write this as 'User Stories'. The format is: "As a [type of user], I want [an action], so that [a benefit]."
- Example: "As a player, I want to see a timer counting down from 5 minutes, so that I know how much time I have left to escape."
- This is how Charles will translate the project brief into actionable items.
**Sprint Backlog:**
- The list of User Stories (and their broken-down tasks) that we have committed to completing in the current Sprint.
- We can use the "GitHub Projects Kanban Board" feature for this. We can create columns like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
**The Increment:**
- The sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint. At the end of each Sprint, we should have a new version of the game. It won't be the full game, but it will be a working version of it.
