# Adapted Agile & Scrum framework
<br></br>

## Agile - The Philosophy

- **Software that works is key:** Our main goal is to have a new playable piece of the game at each weekly meeting.
- **Customer Collaboration:** We have a customer. Getting their feedback regularly to ensure we're building the right thing is key.
- **Team Collaboration:** Agile relies on self-organising teams. Our roles should be flexible - success comes from everyone feeling responsible for the final product.

## Scrum - The Framework

In official Scrum, there are only three roles. Here is how we will adapt:

- **Product Owner:** They represent the customer and decide what the team should build. They are in charge of the master to-do list. This will be Charles (Requirement Lead), responsible for talking to the lecturer, understanding the requirements, and prioritising features to be built
- **Scrum Master:** They manage the process. They will help the team use Scrum effectively, remove any obstacles ("we can't decide on a library"), and keep things running smoothly. This will be Dash as he is the Project Lead.
- **The Development Team:** Everyone is a developer responsible for delivering a finished piece of the game.


### The Scrum Events

We will use Sprints for our project that last one week.

1. **Sprint Planning:**
  - At the beginning of each week in our meeting, the product owner (Charles) will present the highest priority features from the master to-do list. Everyone will decide how much of that work we can realistically complete within the week. We then break down the features into small, concrete tasks.
2. **Daily Scrum:**
  - Not required for a project of this size, although we should stay in touch over the Instagram group chat about where we are at during the week.
3. **Sprint Review:**
  - At the end of the Sprint, we will demonstrate the working software we built during the week. This is a live demo of the game. The goal is to get feedback from each other.
  - This is the perfect time to show progress to the team and, if possible, our customer.
4. **Sprint Retrospective:**
  - Just before starting the next Sprint, we will discuss how it went. What went well, what didn't, what we will change in the next Sprint.
  - Hannah (Secretary) will be responsible for documenting the one or two "action items" the team agrees to implement in the next Sprint.

### Scrum Artifacts

**Product Backlog:**
- The single, master to-do list for the entire project, ordered by priority.
- Here, Charles will translate the project brief into actionable items.

**Sprint Backlog:**
- The list of tasks that we have committed to completing in the current Sprint.

**The Increment:**
- The sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint. At the end of each Sprint, we should have a new version of the game. It won't be the full game, but it will be a working version of it.
