<p>
Discussion of agile and scrum framework, decided that we would speak to customer
during each group session so we can update him with what we're doing. Feedback will then be used in next session.

Agile and scrum framework was a bit too complicated so it's complexity is being broken down. e.g Daily scrum is being removed as it is not required for a project this size. Some things are being removed to make it less complicated for the next team that would take over this project

Sections have been assigned to each group member, since Abualhassan was assigned the website which was only worth 3 marks he is joining Hannah and ben in Architecture. He's allowed to jump into any section if others need help with their section

Cassie suggested to not assigned people to implementation until architecture is completed since architecture will using diagrams, UML, tools etc... This will help with developing the prototype of the game

Dash created 5 iterations for the next 5 weeks (Thur-Wed for each iteration). More information will be in the PROCESS.md doc.

Cassie: Make a prototype that we can all look at and understand so we know how the game engine LibGDX is like.

Dash: start programming by next week since we'll most likely have everything in place.

new project is created on github allowing us to create to-do list tasks. Ones that are in progress and implementation to-do tasks. Each group member can contribute in what task they want to do in the to-do list. Members would most likely do tasks in the section they've been assigned to.

<p>
Discussion of what tasks has been completed/not completed:
Complete : initial requirements, website,risk assessment, LibGdx research, HCI usability notes
Incomplete: All implementation, design of map, presentation

Ben - LibGDX is now linked to the Github so everyone can collab on making the game.
Everyone can code but those who don't want to will be assigned something else in the project
Dash - suggested to start coding on it next week (so implemenation will start to be in progress)

Dicussion of the game assets that's going to be implemented in the game:

Ben - Asset lists uploaded on google drive. Group has now decided to use some assets in the list given. Assets chosen are: FantistyTileSet (main asset set) it has interior and exterior designs.Viking village and Tiny swords can be used a bit to see if it works well with the FantastyTileSet.  Castles are included so that can be used to design the buildings.
Cassie - Tile packs must be the same resoulution or the game will not look smooth. The pixel poem dungeon tile set was discarded due to it being an 8 bit resolution.

Some people will help with designing the map (Dash, Ben, Harley). This will be done in a call for an hour. The rest of the people in the group will help with documentation on why these assets were used, why the map is being designed this way and etc...
