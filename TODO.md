-IntelliJ IDE vs Visual Studio Code:IntelliJ is Java-based IDE, widely used by Java developers, and as our project is Java-based, it's a good fit, comes with extensive community support, and most features and integration tools.VS Code requires many extensions to install if we want to use it, but it's good for projects that involve multiple programming languages)
